Firebase-bulma-form
Simple form using bulma-css.
The reason for this project is to manage to create a real time database with firebase.
In order for you to see the database and  the details, you need to have a firebase account 
Also you need to change the keys to your keys + set the "rules" to "true" on firebase.
